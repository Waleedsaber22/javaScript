            JavaScript was originally developed as Live Script by Netscape in the mid-1990s. 
            It was later renamed to JavaScript in 1995, became an ECMA standard in 1997. 
            Now JavaScript is the standard client-side scripting language for web-based applications, 
            and it is supported by virtually all web browsers available today, such as Google Chrome, 
            Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, etc.

            JavaScript: often abbreviated JS is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
            As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, 
            often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. 
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
            It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with 
            text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            <br/><br/><br/>
            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. 
            In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
